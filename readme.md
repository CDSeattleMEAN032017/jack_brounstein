### Wednesday, March 8

Advanced JavaScript: Callbacks, closures, immediate functions

We are mostly skipping the Node.js chapter--it explains in great detail how to run a web server with only Node, but for the rest of the course, we'll be using Express, which does the same thing but with much more convenient syntax.  However, make sure you read the "Node Modules" tab and complete the "Math Module" assignment.

### Thursday, March 9

Express: Building a web server in JavaScript

We'll also be skipping the socket.io portion.  Sockets are really cool, but they're not covered on the belt exam, and I'd rather give you an extra day to practice full MEAN.  We'll talk about socket.io during project week.
